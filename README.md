# [CrowdCue](https://crowdcue.netlify.app)

[CrowdCue](https://crowdcue.netlify.app) comes from the idea of wanting to connect people with music, sharing experiences through it. Giving users the ability to create listening sessions and stream their favourite songs, others would be able to join and listen in real time.

I developed this SPA prototype as my final project for ISDI Coder’s Full Stack Development Bootcamp, incorporating functionalities such as authentication and all CRUD operations, manifested in many ways across the application.

Although CrowdCue has a long way to go to become what it originally was imagined to be, I am very proud of it and of my code :D
